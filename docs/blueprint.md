## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Energetic orange-yellow (#F5A718), embodying dynamism and clarity, perfectly suited for the Twenty20 Math theme.
- Background color: A subtle warm white (#F9F4F0), providing a clean, bright, and focus-friendly canvas that enhances readability without feeling stark.
- Accent color: A vibrant red-orange (#DB3E0C), analogous to the primary but darker and more saturated, ideal for highlighting key actions and call-to-action buttons.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), for its modern, slightly tech-inspired, and precise aesthetic, aligning with the Twenty20 Math concept.
- Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), chosen for its exceptional readability and neutral, objective presentation, which is crucial for mathematical content and general learning materials.
- Use clear, geometric icons with a modern flat design. Icons should reinforce mathematical concepts or learning tools.
- Utilize a clean, grid-based layout for consistent content organization. Prioritize ample white space to prevent visual clutter and enhance focus.
- Implement subtle hover effects and transition animations on interactive elements to provide clear user feedback without distracting from the learning process.
